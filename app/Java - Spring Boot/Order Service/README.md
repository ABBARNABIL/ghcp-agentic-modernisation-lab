# Order Service

A small Spring Boot REST API for managing customer orders, paired with a lightweight React (Vite) operations workspace. It is used as a demo application for **application code modernization** (Java upgrade, CVE remediation, and Azure migration scenarios).

## Project Structure

```
pom.xml                     # Maven build for the backend
src/main/java/...           # Spring Boot application code
  OrderServiceApplication   # Application entry point
  model/Order               # JPA entity + simple status enum
  repository/OrderRepository# Spring Data JPA repository
  service/OrderService      # Business logic
  web/OrderController        # REST endpoints
  config/                   # Web config + data seeding
src/main/resources/         # application.properties
src/test/java/...           # Unit and web tests
frontend/                   # React + Vite UI
```

## Prerequisites

- JDK 25+ and Maven 3.9+ (the build targets Java 25)
- Node.js 18+ (for the frontend)

## Running the Backend

```pwsh
mvn spring-boot:run
```

The API starts on **http://localhost:8080**. An in-memory H2 database is seeded with sample orders on startup, and the H2 console is available at http://localhost:8080/h2-console (JDBC URL `jdbc:h2:mem:orders`, user `sa`, no password).

To build a runnable JAR:

```pwsh
mvn clean package
java -jar target/order-service-1.0.0.jar
```

## Running the Frontend

```pwsh
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

The UI runs on **http://localhost:5173** and proxies `/api` requests to the backend on port 8080.

## Debugging in an IDE

Install the frontend dependencies once before using either IDE configuration:

```pwsh
cd frontend
npm install
```

Stop any manually started processes on ports `8080` and `5173` before launching an IDE configuration.

### VS Code

1. Open the repository root in VS Code and install the recommended **Extension Pack for Java** when prompted.
2. Open **Run and Debug**.
3. Select **Order Service: Full Stack** and press `F5`.

The full-stack configuration starts Vite, launches the Spring Boot application with the Java debugger attached, and opens Chrome at http://127.0.0.1:5173 after the backend is ready. Use **Order Service: Backend** or **Order Service: Frontend** to debug only one layer. If Vite remains active after debugging, run **Tasks: Terminate Task** and select `Order Service: Start Frontend`.

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. Open the repository root and import `app/Java - Spring Boot/Order Service/pom.xml` as a Maven project.
2. Select an installed JDK for the `order-service` module and configure the project Node.js interpreter. The npm run configuration requires IntelliJ's JavaScript and TypeScript plugin.
3. Select **Order Service Full Stack** from the run configuration menu and choose **Debug**.

The shared IntelliJ compound configuration starts **Order Service Backend** as a debuggable Java application and **Order Service Frontend** as the Vite npm process. The frontend configuration opens http://127.0.0.1:5173 automatically. The individual backend and frontend configurations are also available.

## API Reference

Base path: `/api/orders`

| Method | Endpoint                              | Description                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/api/orders`                         | List all orders                          |
| GET    | `/api/orders/{id}`                    | Get a single order by ID (404 if absent) |
| GET    | `/api/orders/customer/{customer}/total` | Sum of order amounts for a customer    |
| POST   | `/api/orders`                         | Create a new order                       |
| PATCH  | `/api/orders/{id}/status?status={value}` | Update an order status                |

### Order model

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "customer": "alice",
  "amount": 120.50,
  "createdAt": "2026-06-09T12:00:00.000+00:00",
  "status": "PENDING"
}
```

`customer` must not be blank and `amount` must be at least `0.01`. New orders always start as `PENDING`. Supported statuses are `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, and `COMPLETED`; this demo deliberately uses direct status updates rather than a workflow engine or transition history.

### Example requests

```pwsh
# List orders
curl http://localhost:8080/api/orders

# Create an order
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/orders `
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" `
  -d '{ "customer": "carol", "amount": 99.99 }'

# Total spend for a customer
curl http://localhost:8080/api/orders/customer/alice/total

# Update an order status
curl -X PATCH "http://localhost:8080/api/orders/1/status?status=PROCESSING"
```

## Frontend Workspace

The single-page workspace keeps all demo data in the existing orders API and adds:

- summary metrics calculated in the browser
- customer or exact order-ID search
- status filtering and date/amount sorting
- inline status updates
- create-order validation and customer-total lookup
- responsive layouts, native dialog behavior, keyboard focus states, and text-based status indicators

These capabilities are intentionally client-side for the small seeded dataset. No charting, component, state-management, or API-client libraries are added.

## Testing

```pwsh
mvn test

cd frontend
npm test
npm run build
```

Backend tests cover the repository, service, validation, and web controller layers. Frontend tests use Node's built-in test runner for search, filtering, sorting, and summary calculations.

## Intentional Scope

The application stays compact so its Java modernization path remains easy to inspect. Authentication, durable production storage, customer/product/line-item models, status history, server-side querying and pagination, analytics endpoints, charts, bulk actions, exports, and notifications remain out of scope. Java, Spring Boot, and vulnerable dependency upgrades are separate workshop exercises.
